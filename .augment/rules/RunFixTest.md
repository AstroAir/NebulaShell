I will provide you with a test file that needs to be executed and debugged. Please:

1. **Run the test file** using the appropriate test runner for the project
2. **Identify and analyze all errors** that occur during execution, including:
   - Compilation/syntax errors
   - Runtime errors
   - Test failures
   - Missing dependencies or imports
3. **Fix each error systematically** by:
   - Understanding the root cause of each issue
   - Making the minimal necessary changes to resolve the problem
   - Ensuring fixes don't break existing functionality
4. **Verify completeness** by ensuring:
   - All test cases pass successfully
   - The implemented functionality matches the test expectations
   - The logic is correct and handles edge cases appropriately
5. **Re-run tests** after each fix to confirm the solution works

Please provide clear explanations for each error found and the reasoning behind your fixes. If you encounter any ambiguities in the test requirements, ask for clarification before proceeding.
