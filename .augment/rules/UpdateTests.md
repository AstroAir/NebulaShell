Update the existing test suite to reflect the latest implementation changes in the codebase. Please:

1. First, analyze the current codebase to identify recent changes and new functionality that may not be covered by existing tests
2. Review the existing test files to understand the current test coverage and identify gaps
3. Update or modify existing tests that may have become outdated due to implementation changes
4. Add new test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of:
   - New features or functionality
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Integration points between components
   - Any modified APIs or interfaces
5. Ensure all tests pass after the updates
6. Verify that the test coverage meets quality standards (aim for high coverage of critical paths)

Focus on maintaining test quality while ensuring the test suite accurately reflects and validates the current state of the implementation.
