Build the complete project from scratch and systematically fix all encountered errors. Please follow these steps:

1. First, analyze the current project structure and identify the build system being used (e.g., npm, Maven, Gradle, Make, etc.)
2. Attempt to build the project using the appropriate build command
3. If build errors occur, analyze each error message carefully and implement fixes in order of priority:
   - Dependency issues (missing packages, version conflicts)
   - Compilation errors (syntax errors, missing imports, type mismatches)
   - Configuration issues (missing config files, incorrect paths)
   - Environment setup problems
4. After fixing each error, re-run the build to verify the fix and identify any remaining issues
5. Continue this process iteratively until the project builds successfully without errors
6. Provide a summary of all errors encountered and the solutions implemented
7. Verify the final build produces the expected output/artifacts

Please document each error and its solution for future reference, and suggest any improvements to prevent similar issues in the future.
