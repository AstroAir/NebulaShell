I will provide you with a TSX test file that needs to be executed and debugged. Please:

1. **Run the test file** using the appropriate test runner (Jest, Vitest, or whatever testing framework is configured in the project)
2. **Identify and fix all errors** that occur during test execution, including:
   - Compilation errors (TypeScript/JSX syntax issues)
   - Runtime errors (missing dependencies, incorrect imports, etc.)
   - Test failures (assertion errors, logic issues)
   - Configuration issues (missing test setup, environment problems)
3. **Ensure the functionality and logic are sound** by:

   - Verifying that test cases cover the intended behavior
   - Checking that assertions are meaningful and correct
   - Confirming that the test structure follows best practices
   - Making sure the tests actually validate the component/function being tested

4. **Provide explanations** for each fix you make, explaining why the error occurred and how your solution addresses it

Please wait for me to share the TSX test file before proceeding with the analysis and fixes.
